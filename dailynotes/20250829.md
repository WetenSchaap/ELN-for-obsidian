## This is an example daily note

[[Readme|Return to the readme page]]

When a new note is generated, the note will have the date of today as its title, formatted as `yyyymmdd`. This is easiest for sorting. The content of the note you can see below. 

First, the note will have 2 properties, which you can see above: the current date, and the creation date (the date on which you made this note).

Second, there is a *To do* list for today. Fill this out with things you want/need to do, and tick them off when you are done.

Then, there is the *Long-term todo* list. This list will be in the note every day, so it is a good way of keeping track of long-term plans and goals. You can edit the long-term todo's [[Long-term todo|in this note]]. If you change things there, it will change in *all* daily notes, past and future.

Next, is the *Running experiments*, which will display currently running experiments, as filtered by the [[Experiments.base]] file, more info on that in the [[Readme]] note.

Finally, there is a *Random Notes* section to scribble down random notes and thoughts.

To change the template for this note, just make changes in [[__templates/DailyNote|the DailyNote template]]. You should probably leave the code stuff alone unless you know what you are doing, but the rest you can (of course) change to your liking!
## To do today:

- [/] Make an example vault you can use as ELN.
- [ ] Go to bed early.

I should call my grandmother more often.

Maybe I should get a cat.
