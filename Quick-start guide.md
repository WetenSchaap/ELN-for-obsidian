Quick-start guide: my Obsidian ELN template

## 1. Try it

Open Obsidian, let it create today’s daily note, and start writing. Run it in parallel with your old notebook for a few days - if it doesn’t feel right, stop using it. If you like it, stop using your old notebook.

## 2. Four note types

All templates live in `__templates/`. Tweak anything you want.

- **Daily note** – Opens automatically each morning. Dump tasks, meetings, quick thoughts, and link to other notes.
- **Experiment** – `Ctrl+N` from any experiment note → new experiment `DATE_YOURINITIALS01`. Change your initials in the template.
- **Stock/Sample** – `Ctrl+N` from any stock note → log reagents, aliquots, etc.
- **Meeting** – Same shortcut inside the meetings folder.
- **Literature** – Decide what works for you; Zotero + Zotero Link plugin works well.

Add or remove note types freely.
## 3. Bases

Open any `.base` file for a filterable spreadsheet view of your notes.
