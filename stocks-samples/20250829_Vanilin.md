> Note the many properties above. These are probably mainly interesting for chemists, but you can (of course) think of any properties you want. Set them in the [[__templates/Stock|Stock template file]] to automatically add the properties to every new sample note you make.

I weighed in 0.7 g of vanilin and dissolved in 200 mL of water. Similar to [[stocks-samples/20250312_Vanilin|20250312_Vanilin]].

### Calculate how much you need to weigh in:
```math
mw = 152.149
final_volume_ml = 200
concentration_mM = 23
to_be_weighted = (mw/1000*concentration_mM)/1000*final_volume_ml
```
