Before we write anything in the experiment, take a look at the `properties` above. These properties describe your experiments, and will be very useful to find your experiment back later. You can give the *start date* and *end date*, which are obviously useful, a nice *title* that describes what you did, and tick-boxes  that indicate whether the experiment was *Completed*, if the experiment was *Useful*, and if an experiment gave data of high enough quality to end up in a paper. You can set more properties if you like. If you add the properties to the `Experiment` template [[__templates/Experiment|here]], and they will show up in all new experiments you make.
## Goal & background
An experiment should begin by a short description of the goal & background of your experiment, ideally with links to related previous experiments, and other relevant documents.  For instance:

> This experiment is a re-try of [[experiments/20250829_PJMS02|20250829_PJMS02]] - maybe it will randomly work now?

> This experiment was performed in the context of X and Y project. I change X and Y based on my discussion with Alex, see [[meetings/20250829_meeting-with-collaborator|20250829_meeting-with-collaborator]].

### A note on protocols
If you perform the same or similar experiments often, you *could* make a protocol experiment, and link that every time to save time. Be careful however! if you update your protocol, your old experiment will refer to the updated version, which is probably different to what you actually did. Therefore, I would advice to always copy-paste the protocol to the experiment note instead, and make any necessary changes. This way, the actual steps you've taken are always preserved.

## Procedure
Now, with the background out of the way, you can actually start the experiment. I will show some examples of stuff you can add to your experiment file.

First, you can link to any other file in this Obsidian vault if it contains important information. For instance, if you use some sample or stock, or reference something from another experiment, you should always link to that:

> I now add two components together. I use the previously prepared  [[stocks-samples/20250829_Vanilin|20250829_Vanilin]] stock. take 12 mL of that, and mix it with something else.

Of course you can include pictures or graphs from machines. Just copy-paste them in:

Do not include *actual* experimental data, this will grow the size of your vault uncontrollably. Instead, name data that belongs to this experiment after the experiment label, *20250901_PJMS01* in this case. This way, you can always find the right data for the right experiment.


If you need a quick sketch to explain something to your future self, you can use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) directly in Obsidian. Include a drawing at your cursor by pressing `ctrl+D`. Double-click on an existing drawing to edit it.

Sometimes, you may want to do a quick calculation. For that, you can make a math block:

```math
mw = 732.85
final_volume_ml = 10
concentration_mM = 20
to_be_weighted = (mw/1000*concentration_mM)/1000*final_volume_ml
```

You can even use units!
```math
2mm * 2m * 2cm
```

To use those, just type three backticks (these things: `` ` ``) followed by math before and after your calculation:
``` 
> ```math
> 2mm * 2m * 2cm
> ```
```
 
Sometimes, calculations get too complex, or you want to re-use the same calculation often.  For this, you can use a standard Excel/Calc spreadsheet. You can make the spreadsheet part of Obsidian: simply paste the file into the `/spreadsheets` folder, and you can link these from your experiments: [[Spreadsheets/exciting_calculator_sheet.ods|click here for a calc sheet]]. Do note that you need to copy the result from the spreadsheet into the note, or the result will be lost next time you change the spreadsheet - see my note on protocols above.

## Results & Takeaway
Finally, after an experiment, it is generally a good idea to quickly write the main result or takeaway down. Or it will be difficult to trace down what happened later.
