## Goal & background
Previous and related experiments: This is my first experiment, so there is no previous experiment.

I want to win a Ig Nobel prize. To achieve this goal, I need a good idea first. Let's write some random ideas down here.

### Idea nr 1: breeding a spherical cow
How hard can it be. It would be great for physicists. Potential collaboration with ESA? Email them later!!

### Idea 2: Fixing world hunger
Nah boring

### Idea 3: Make graphene, but on a colloidal lengthscale
Ok this sounds great. Let's look into literature.

Oh no! It's been done already! Curses!
